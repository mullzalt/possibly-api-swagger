## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js v.16+

1. Install the project dependencies.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Useful commands

The project will build, lint, and preview the OpenAPI document from the terminal, with the following commands:

### Build

The command bundles the spec as one `.yaml` file.

```
npm run build
```

The minified document is stored in `_build/openapi.yaml`.

### Test

The command checks if the document follows the OpenAPI 3.1.0 Specification.

```
npm run test
```

### Preview

The command builds a docs site so that you can view the rendering on your local browser.

```
npm run preview
```

The server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8080
